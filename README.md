# odin-recipes
This project is a website featuring several food recipes. Each recipe has a link that will redirect the user to a page featuring an image, description, ingredients, and steps to make the recipe. This project uses html skills such as creating the html boilerplate, paragraphs, headings, lists, links, and images.
